## Design Philosophy: Premium Medical Aesthetics with Elegant Femininity

### Design Movement
**Contemporary Luxury Healthcare** — A blend of modern minimalism with soft, sophisticated femininity. Inspired by high-end dermatology clinics and luxury wellness brands that balance professionalism with approachability.

### Core Principles
1. **Sophisticated Softness**: Use soft, warm pinks paired with clean whites to create a premium yet welcoming atmosphere
2. **Medical Professionalism**: Maintain hospital-standard clarity and trust through clean typography, ample whitespace, and organized layouts
3. **Feminine Elegance**: Incorporate subtle curves, soft gradients, and refined details without appearing childish
4. **Accessibility & Trust**: Clear information hierarchy, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation that builds confidence

### Color Philosophy
- **Primary**: Soft rose pink (#E8B4C8) and blush pink (#F5E6E8) — conveys warmth, care, and femininity
- **Accent**: Deep magenta (#C85A7C) for CTAs and highlights — draws attention while maintaining sophistication
- **Neutral**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds and light gray (#6B7280) for text — ensures readability and professionalism
- **Reasoning**: Pink suggests care and beauty, white ensures medical credibility, deep magenta creates visual hierarchy without aggression

### Layout Paradigm
- **Asymmetric Hero**: Hero section with text on left, soft gradient overlay on background image (right-aligned)
- **Card-Based Sections**: News and services displayed in organized grids with subtle shadows and hover effects
- **Two-Column Contact**: Information on left, embedded map on right for intuitive navigation
- **Breathing Space**: Generous padding and whitespace between sections to feel luxurious and uncluttered

### Signature Elements
1. **Soft Gradient Overlays**: Subtle pink-to-white gradients on hero and section backgrounds
2. **Rounded Cards**: Gentle border-radius (12-16px) on news cards and service items for approachability
3. **Subtle Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows (not sharp) to create depth without harshness

### Interaction Philosophy
- **Smooth Transitions**: All hover states and interactions use 300ms ease-in-out transitions
- **Hover Elevation**: Cards and buttons lift slightly on hover to indicate interactivity
- **CTA Emphasis**: Pink buttons with deeper magenta on hover to guide user actions

### Animation Guidelines
- **Page Transitions**: Fade-in animations (200ms) for sections as they enter viewport
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scale (1.02x) and shadow increase on interactive elements
- **Button States**: Smooth color transitions on hover and active states
- **Scroll Reveals**: Cards fade in and slide up slightly as user scrolls

### Typography System
- **Font Family**: Kanit (Google Font) for all headings and body text
- **Heading Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Hero): 48px bold, letter-spacing -0.5px
  - H2 (Section): 36px bold, letter-spacing -0.3px
  - H3 (Card/Subsection): 20px semi-bold
- **Body Text**: 16px regular for readability, 14px for secondary information
- **Line Height**: 1.6 for body, 1.3 for headings
